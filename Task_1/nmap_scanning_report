Task 1 -  Scan Your Local Network for Open Ports

Step 1: Download Nmap
	sudo apt install nmap

Step 2: Find local IP range (192.168.xx.xx/16)

Step 3: Do TCP SYN Scan 
	nmap -sS 192.168.xx.xx/16	
	
	Nmap scan report for _gateway (192.168.xx.xx)
	Host is up (0.0038s latency).
	Not shown: 991 filtered ports
	PORT     STATE  SERVICE
	80/tcp   open   http
	443/tcp  open   https
	1900/tcp open   upnp
	8080/tcp open   http-proxy
	8443/tcp open   https-alt

	
Step 4: Analyse Open Ports
	
	80, 443: For HTTP & HTTPS Protocols
	1900: Universal Plug and Play port is used for device discovery and enables devices on local network to automatically find, connect and control each other. It is said to be accessable in internal network only and not from the internet
	8080: Works as an alt for HTTP 80 port, used for proxy service for dev or test env.
	8443: Alt for HTTPS 443 port, is an alt when 443 not available.
