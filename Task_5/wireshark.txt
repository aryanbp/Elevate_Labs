Task 5 : Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark.

Step 1: Install Wireshark
	sudo apt install wireshark
	
Step 2: Open Wireshark with sudo permission
	sudo wireshark

Step 3: Capture wlpls Traffic (Wifi) & Save File

Step 4: Analyse capture packets and understand protocols
	
	TCP,UDP,ARP,DNS
	
	TCP: Trasmission Control Protocol 
		Is connection oriented protocol.
		Uses 3 way handshake to ensure reliable communication of data.
		Ensures Data Integrity and delivery order.
		Used at Transport layer
		
	UDP: User Datagram Protocol
		Is connectionless communication protocol.
		Sends message in network without any dedicated connection beforehand.
		Know for speed and efficiency.
		Suitable for application where occasional packet loss is acceptable like streaming,gaming and so on.
		Also used at Transpot Layer i.e Layer 4	
		
	ARP: Address Resolution Protocol
		Used to resolve MAC address of a device on network
		Used at the Data link layer 
		Important for communication and routing in local network
		
	DNS: Domain Name System
		Every device on the internet / network has an ip address to identify itself. DNS converts this IP to Human Readable Form so that humans can access the resources easily.
		It is an application layer protocol
		And also convert human readable format back to IP 
		

The network communication happens in layer format i.e the TCP/IP communication and these protocols are part of those layer helping the data to travel from one location to another in a efficient,secure and reliable way.
